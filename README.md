- 👋 Hi, I’m @jhenac. I am a single parent to a young daughter, and I am passionate about programming and upskilling.
- 👀 I also love to cook, sing at karaoke sessions, and ride a motorcycle. I prefer role-playing games like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Sleeping Dogs, and The Witcher 3. My TV genre are a mixed of fantasy, action, and comedy such as The Wheel of Time, Daredevil, Sherlock, Moon Knight, IT Crowd, and Brooklyn Nine Nine.
- 📝 I started my programming journey in 2022 taking up Udemy's Python Zero to Hero course by Dr. Angela Yu. For three years now, I created several programs for personal projects, commissioned gigs, and in freelance capacity.
- 🌱 I worked in a bank for twelve years prior to transitioning to an Analyts Programmer role for a remote client in 2023. I also do web scraping on the side presently.
- 💞️ In 2024, I have achieved my long term goal to become a data engineer. I am currently a data engineer for a multinational company.
- 👩‍💻 I still have a long way to go and so I seek to leverage my programming skills on the side. Here are what I can do:
-   ✅ Python programming including object-oriented programming principles
-   ✅ Pipeline maintenance and ETL processes (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Qlik Replicate)
-   ✅ Code versioning and CI/CD development (Git, Bitbucket, Jenkins)
-   ✅ Technical documentation and video creation (IT Confluence, ClipChamp)
-   ✅ Use of business workflows (ServiceNow, Jira)
-   ✅ Web scraping with Selenium Webdriver, Beautiful Soup, requests, Octoparse, and WebHarvy
-   ✅ Data cleaning (pandas)
-   ✅ SQL database design and management (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
-   ✅ Backend development with Flask framework and RESTful routing
-   ✅ Familiarity with frontend languages like HTML, CSS, JS and Boostrap framework
-   ✅ Familiarity with data analysis and visualization using plotly, matplotlib, seaborn
